### How a Duel is Born

Every story begins with a spark - and in our case, that spark is a **player’s decision to start a duel.**

Someone, somewhere, clicks _“Play.”_  
That single action sets the system in motion.

Behind that innocent button, a few invisible steps happen - the kind that make the difference between a toy and a working system.

#### **Step 1 — The Challenge**

When a player hits “Play,” the frontend sends a simple request to the backend:

```text
POST /duel/start
```

That endpoint doesn’t create a duel right away - it creates a **challenge**.  
A challenge is like saying: “I’m ready. Find me an opponent.”

This step lets us separate **intention** from **action.**  
In distributed systems, that’s gold - it means we can queue, match, or cancel safely without breaking the flow.

The backend stores this challenge in a lightweight structure:

```go
{
  playerID: "P001",
  status: "waiting",
  createdAt: "2025-10-31T18:00:00Z"
}
```

Simple, but scalable.  
If no opponent arrives within a few seconds, we can even trigger an AI opponent - a fallback that keeps the experience smooth.

#### **Step 2 — The Matchmaker**

Somewhere in our cloud, a **matchmaker process** wakes up.  
Its only job is to watch for lonely challengers and connect them.  
When it finds two compatible players (or one human and one AI), it creates a new record:

```go
{
  duelID: "D123",
  players: ["P001", "P002"],
  state: "starting",
  questions: [],
  createdAt: ...
}
```

That’s the birth of a duel - a microcosm of logic, waiting to unfold.

#### **Step 3 — The Arena**

Once the duel is created, both players receive a notification:

> “Opponent found. Get ready!”

Here we have a decision to make - should we use WebSockets for live interaction or keep it simple with request/response polling?

We’ll start simple.  
A good architect doesn’t overcomplicate the first step - we’ll use stateless APIs and maybe a touch of in-memory state to simulate real-time behavior. Later, we can evolve to WebSockets, event streams, or even serverless functions triggered by updates.

This staged growth mirrors real projects: **start with clarity, evolve with purpose.**

#### **Step 4 — The Game Loop**

The duel begins.  
Each round, the backend picks a question from a shared trivia bank (stored in a JSON or DynamoDB table), sends it to both players, and waits for their answers.

Players answer through:

```text
POST /duel/{duelID}/answer
```

The backend checks correctness, updates the score, and sends feedback.  
After a few rounds, the duel ends - not with fireworks, but with a neat, quiet line of JSON:

```go
{
  duelID: "D123",
  winner: "P001",
  score: { "P001": 4, "P002": 2 },
  finishedAt: ...
}
```

And that’s it - a completed duel, ready for leaderboard recording or replay.
